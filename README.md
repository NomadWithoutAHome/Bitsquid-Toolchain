# Bitsquid-Toolchain
A set of tools for interacting with Bitsquid engine game assets. Tested on HELLDIVERS. Modified and re-compiled.

These tools are not originally created by me. They can be found from http://zenhax.com/viewtopic.php?t=1019. Thank you id-daemon for those awesome tools.

With no source code released, I decomplied the tools with ILSpy and made some modification to the tools including exception fixes and better logging.

Expect bad readability as the source code comes from decompilation.
